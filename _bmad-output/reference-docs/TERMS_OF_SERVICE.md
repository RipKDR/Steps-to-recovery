## Health and Safety Disclaimer

### Not Medical Advice

**THE APP DOES NOT PROVIDE MEDICAL ADVICE.** The content and features of this App are for informational and self-reflection purposes only. The App is not intended to:

- Diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease or condition
- Replace professional medical or mental health treatment
- Serve as a substitute for addiction treatment programs
- Replace the guidance of a licensed healthcare provider

**If you are experiencing a medical emergency, suicidal thoughts, or are in immediate danger, please:**

- Call emergency services (911 in the US)
- Contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 988
- Contact the SAMHSA National Helpline: 1-800-662-4357
- Go to your nearest emergency room

The crisis tools in this App are supplementary resources and should not be relied upon as your primary source of emergency support.

### Your Recovery Program

This App is designed to complement, not replace, established recovery programs (such as 12-step programs, therapy, treatment centers, or support groups). We strongly encourage you to:

## Privacy and Data

### Local-First Architecture

Your privacy is our priority. The App is designed with a local-first architecture, meaning:

- Your journal entries and sensitive data are stored only on your device
- Data is encrypted before storage using AES-256 encryption
- We do not have access to your personal entries or recovery data
- Optional cloud backup (if enabled) stores only encrypted data

For complete details, see our [Privacy Policy](PRIVACY_POLICY.md).

### Data Loss

Because your data is stored locally on your device:

- **You are responsible for backing up your data**
- Uninstalling the App will delete all local data
- We cannot recover lost data
- Device damage or loss may result in permanent data loss

We recommend using the export feature regularly if you wish to preserve your data.
