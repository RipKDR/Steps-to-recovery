## Our Privacy Promise

Recovery Companion was built with one core belief: **your recovery journey is deeply personal and should remain completely private.**

We've designed this app to be a sanctuary where you can process your thoughts and track your progress without ever worrying about who might see your data.

## What We DON'T Do

 ❌ No Data Collection
We do not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal information to any external servers. Period.

❌ No Analytics
We don't track how you use the app, what features you access, or when you open the app.

 ❌ No User Accounts
There are no accounts to create, no passwords to remember, and no cloud sync. Your data exists only on your device.

 ❌ No Advertising
We don't show ads, and we don't share any information with advertisers.

 ❌ No Third-Party Sharing
We never share, sell, or provide access to your data to any third party.

## What We DO

 ✅ Local-Only Storage
All your data — journal entries, check-ins, milestones, and settings — is stored exclusively on your device using encrypted local storage.

 ✅ On-Device Encryption
Your journal entries and sensitive content are encrypted using industry-standard AES encryption before being stored locally. Even if someone gains access to your device's file system, they cannot read your entries without your biometric authentication or PIN.

 ✅ Biometric Security
Optional Face ID, Touch ID, or PIN protection ensures only you can access your recovery data.

 ✅ Your Data, Your Control
You can:

- Export all your data anytime as a JSON file
- Delete all your data permanently whenever you choose
- Use the app completely offline
