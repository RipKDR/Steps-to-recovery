# Claude Session Context

This folder contains markdown files that preserve context between Claude Code sessions, reducing token usage and maintaining memory of ongoing work.

## Current Sessions

| File | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| `android-production-readiness.md` | Android/Expo production fixes | In Progress |

## How to Use

1. **Starting a new session**: Reference the relevant file to resume context
2. **During work**: Update the session file with completed items
3. **Ending session**: Ensure all progress is documented

## When to Create New Files

- Starting a major feature or refactor
- Multi-day implementation tasks
- Complex debugging sessions
- Architecture decisions that span sessions

## File Naming Convention

`<feature-or-task-name>.md`

Examples:
- `android-production-readiness.md`
- `encryption-refactor.md`
- `sync-service-v2.md`
