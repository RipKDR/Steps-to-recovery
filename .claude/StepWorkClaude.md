  CREATE TABLE step_work (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    step_number INTEGER NOT NULL,
    encrypted_content TEXT NOT NULL,
    is_completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0,
    created_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
    updated_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
    sync_status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending'
  );
  ```

### User Experience
